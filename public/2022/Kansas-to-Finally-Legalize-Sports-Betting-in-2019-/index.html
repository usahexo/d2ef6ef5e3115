            <h1 id="Kansas-to-Finally-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-2019"><a href="#Kansas-to-Finally-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="Kansas to Finally Legalize Sports Betting in 2019"></a>Kansas to Finally Legalize Sports Betting in 2019</h1><p>After years of failed attempts, the state of Kansas is finally ready to legalize sports betting. Governor Jeff Colyer signed the bill into law on April 30th, 2019, making Kansas the latest state to join the growing legalized sports betting market.</p>
<p>The new law allows for both in-person and online sports betting, with operators paying a 6.75% tax on gross gaming revenue. Bettors must be at least 21 years old and located within the state in order to participate.</p>
<p>Kansas joins 13 other states that have legalized some form of sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down the federal ban in May 2018. While other states have seen rapid growth in their sports betting markets, Kansas is expected to be a bit slower off the ground due to its small population and lack of existing gambling infrastructure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, officials are optimistic that legalization will bring in new revenue for the state and help create jobs in the gaming industry.</p>
<h1 id="Timeline-for-Kansas-Sports-Betting-Set"><a href="#Timeline-for-Kansas-Sports-Betting-Set" class="headerlink" title="Timeline for Kansas Sports Betting Set"></a>Timeline for Kansas Sports Betting Set</h1><p>After the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in May, many states scrambled to get sports betting legislation in place. The Kansas Legislature was not one of those states. </p>
<p>In a statement to The Topeka Capital-Journal, Governor Jeff Colyer’s office said, “The governor is supportive of allowing Kansans to make their own choices when it comes to gaming, and he looks forward to working with the Legislature next year to pass a bill that would legalize sports betting in our state.” </p>
<p>That work will start in January when the legislature reconvenes. There is no specific bill yet, but there are a few things that need to happen before sports betting can become a reality in Kansas.</p>
<p>First, the state needs to define what constitutes a bet and who is allowed to take them. That may seem like a simple task, but there are some complexities. For example, does a bet on which team will win the Super Bowl constitute gambling? What about prop bets? Is it legal for someone other than the casinos or racetracks to take bets? </p>
<p>Second, the state needs to decide how it will tax sports betting. There are two options: an excise tax or a percentage of each bet. An excise tax would be charged on each bet regardless of whether or not the bettor won or lost. A percentage of each bet would be taken from the winning bets and given back to the losers. </p>
<p>Both methods have pros and cons. An excise tax would generate more revenue for the state, but it would also be unpopular with bettors. A percentage of each bet would be more popular with bettors, but it would generate less revenue for the state. </p>
<p>Third, the state needs to establish regulations for sports betting operators. This includes things like how old someone has to be to gamble, what types of bets are legal, how much can someone wager at one time, etc. </p>
<p>Once all of that is done, Kansas residents will be able to place legal sports bets. The earliest that could happen is sometime in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Kansas-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Coming-Months"><a href="#Kansas-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Coming-Months" class="headerlink" title="Kansas Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in Coming Months"></a>Kansas Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in Coming Months</h1><p>As the US Supreme Court readies its decision on the legality of sports betting, several states are preparing legislation to legalize the activity within their borders in the event that it is deemed lawful. Kansas is one of these states, and lawmakers there are confident that sports betting will be legalized in the near future.</p>
<p>There is already some precedent for legal sports betting in Kansas; in 2015, state lawmakers passed a bill that allowed for fantasy sports betting. That law was challenged in court, but was ultimately upheld. The state’s gaming commission has been preparing for sports betting legalization since then,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> and is confident that they will be able to quickly roll out a regulated industry if the Supreme Court rules in favor of legalizing sports betting nationwide.</p>
<p>Kansas would join a number of other states, including New Jersey and West Virginia, that have already moved to legalize sports betting in anticipation of a Supreme Court ruling. Nevada is currently the only state where sports betting is legal, but that could soon change if the high court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in the case.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting argue that it would provide a new source of revenue for states, as well as create new jobs in the gambling industry. They also argue that it would help to reduce illegal gambling, which is currently estimated to be a $150 billion industry.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalization argue that it could lead to increased addiction and gambling problems, as well as corruption in professional sporting events. They also claim that it would be difficult to regulate and could potentially be harmful to consumers.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling on the legality of sports betting by the end of June. In the meantime, lawmakers in states around the country are preparing legislation to legalize the activity should it be deemed lawful.</p>
<h1 id="State-Senate-Expects-Vote-on-Sports-Betting-This-Spring"><a href="#State-Senate-Expects-Vote-on-Sports-Betting-This-Spring" class="headerlink" title="State Senate Expects Vote on Sports Betting This Spring"></a>State Senate Expects Vote on Sports Betting This Spring</h1><p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York state senators say they expect a vote on a bill to legalize sports betting this spring.</p>
<p>The Senate’s racing, gaming and Wagering Committee is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposal Wednesday.</p>
<p>Senators Chuck Schumer and John Bonacic are among the sponsors of the bill, which would allow wagers on professional and college sports, including baseball, basketball, football, hockey and soccer.</p>
<p>It would also allow bets on horse races and other sporting events.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the committee says it’s not clear yet when the full Senate might vote on the bill.</p>
<h1 id="Kansas-Lawmakers-Announce-Plans-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Kansas-Lawmakers-Announce-Plans-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Kansas Lawmakers Announce Plans to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Kansas Lawmakers Announce Plans to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>The state of Kansas, which has seen its economy battered in recent years by the decline of the agricultural sector, is looking to legalize sports betting as a way to bolster its coffers.</p>
<p>State legislators announced plans on Monday to introduce a bill that would allow residents to bet on sports games both through casinos and online. The proposed bill would also levy a tax of 10 percent on all gambling winnings.</p>
<p>“This is an important step in helping to grow our economy and provide much-needed revenue for critical state services,” said state Rep. John Wilson, a Democrat from Lawrence who is sponsoring the bill.</p>
<p>If passed, Kansas would join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports betting in the wake of a landmark Supreme Court decision last year that struck down a federal ban on the activity.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalization say it could generate millions of dollars in new revenue for cash-strapped states, while opponents argue that it will lead to increased addictive behavior and other social problems.</p>
<p>Kansas already has a number of casinos and racetracks, which could offer sports betting if the proposed bill is approved. It was not clear how much money the state stood to gain from legalization, but similar proposals elsewhere have been projected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars annually.</p>
