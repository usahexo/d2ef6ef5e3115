#  Boston Celtics jump to the front of the line for title contenders with legalized sports betting

If you're a fan of the Boston Celtics, then the news of legalized sports betting in the United States has to be music to your ears.

Prior to this legalization, your options for betting on Celtics games were limited to offshore sportsbooks, which often came with high fees and slow payouts. Not anymore.

Now that sports betting is legal in the US, you can place bets on the Celtics at your local sportsbook, or even better, at a new online sportsbook like https://bostoncelticsbetting.com/. This site is dedicated to providing information on all things Celtics betting, including game previews, odds and tips.

So why are the Celtics such clear favourites for title contention now that sports betting is legal? It all comes down to two factors: depth and experience.

Depth - The Celtics are one of the deepest teams in the league, with players that can step up and contribute no matter who is injured or resting. This was evident during their playoff run last year, when they knocked out LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers without Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward.

Experience - The Celtics have a ton of experience playing together, thanks in part to their young core. This experience was on full display during their playoff run last year, when they managed to come back from a 2-0 deficit against Philadelphia and win the series four games to two.

#  Boston Celtics see increased profits as sports betting is legalized

In the aftermath of the legalization of sports betting in the United States, the Boston Celtics have seen their profits increase exponentially. With sports fans now able to legally bet on their favorite games, the Celtics have become one of the most popular teams in the country to place a wager on.

The NBA’s top team took in nearly $2 million in profits during the month of October, a staggering figure that is more than double what they made during the same month last year. The betting public has flocked to place bets on the Celtics, and as a result they are consistently one of the most heavily wagered upon teams in North America.

The Celtics aren’t alone in benefiting from legalized sports betting; all major league sports teams have seen their profits skyrocket since it became legal. This is largely due to the fact that Americans can now place bets without having to worry about breaking any laws, as sports betting was previously considered a ‘grey area’.

This new found freedom has led to an increase in gambling addiction rates across the country, something that has caused concern for some lawmakers. However, for the majority of Americans this increased availability of gambling has been a positive thing, as it has allowed them to legally wager on their favorite teams and players.

It remains to be seen if this trend will continue throughout the season, but it is clear that the legalization of sports betting has had a massive impact on America’s professional sports leagues.
