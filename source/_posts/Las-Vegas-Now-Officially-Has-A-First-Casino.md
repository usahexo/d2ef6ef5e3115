#  Las Vegas Now Officially Has A First Casino

Las Vegas is now home to its first casino. The opening of the casino is a sign that the city is continuing to rebound from the recession.

The new casino is called The Lucky Dragon and it is a small, family-owned business. The owner, David Jacobson, says that he has been dreaming of this day for many years.

The Lucky Dragon will be competing with larger casinos in the city such as the MGM Grand and the Wynn Las Vegas. It offers 243 slot machines and 27 table games.

The opening of the casino has been met with mixed reactions. Some people are excited about it, while others believe that it will have a negative impact on the city.

Some experts believe that Las Vegas still has a lot of work to do in order to recover from the recession. The Lucky Dragon casino may help to revive the city's economy, but only time will tell.

#  Casino History Is Made In Las Vegas

The early days of Las Vegas were filled with stories of poker games, illegal casinos and gangsters. However, it was the development of gambling tourism that turned this small desert town into the gambling capital of the world.

The 1930s brought mobsters such as Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky to Las Vegas in order to capitalize on its potential. They opened hotels and casinos, quickly establishing a reputation for glamour and excitement.

As casino gambling became more popular, so did Sin City. The 1940s brought bigger and better casinos, such as the Flamingo Hotel which was built by Bugsy Siegel. Gambling was legalized in Nevada in 1941, further fueling the growth of Las Vegas.

The 1950s saw the development of even larger casinos, including the Stardust Resort and Casino and the Rio Suites Hotel. In 1955, Las Vegas Strip was officially born with the opening of the Sands Hotel. This iconic hotel was home to some of the biggest names in entertainment, including Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley.

Throughout its history, Las Vegas has been known for its glitzy hotels and casinos. Today, it remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

#  Welcome To The First Casino Of Las Vegas

Las Vegas is a world-famous destination for gambling and nightlife. What many people don't know, however, is that it is also home to the first casino ever built in the state of Nevada. The Rat Pack may have immortalized it in song and movie, but today the El Cortez is still going strong and offering guests a truly unique Las Vegas experience.

From its beginnings as a humble ground-floor operation to its current status as a luxurious 24-hour casino, the El Cortez has always been at the forefront of gaming innovation. In fact, when owner Jackie Gaughan first opened his doors in 1941, he was one of only two casinos in town that offered blackjack.

Today, of course, the El Cortez offers a much wider range of games, including slots, craps, roulette, and poker. But what really sets this casino apart from the rest is its intimate atmosphere and personal service. Gaughan's philosophy has always been that it's more important to make each guest feel welcome than to maximize profits, and that commitment to customer satisfaction is evident in everything from the quality of the food to the friendliness of the staff.

So if you're looking for an old-school Las Vegas experience with all the modern amenities, be sure to pay a visit to the El Cortez!
