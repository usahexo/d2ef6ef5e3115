#  How to Ignore Blackjack: A Thoreau Primer

"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

This sentiment, expressed by Henry David Thoreau in his essay "Life without Principle," could easily be applied to the game of blackjack. The average player's goal is to beat the casino, but all too often they find themselves losing money instead.

There is a better way: ignore blackjack completely.

It may sound like heresy, but there are plenty of other casino games to enjoy that don't require as much concentration and skill. Craps and roulette, for example, are games of chance that can be enjoyed with little effort. You can simply place your bets and let the chips fall where they may.

There's no need to stress out over blackjack - or any other casino game for that matter. If you're not enjoying yourself, then you're doing it wrong. So take a break from blackjack and try something new. You may be surprised at just how much fun you can have without even touching a deck of cards.

#  How to Ignore Blackjack and Love Life

Back when I was in college, I had a great friend named Alex. Alex was the life of the party and always had a great attitude about everything. No matter what life threw at him, he would always find a way to laugh it off.

One day, I asked Alex how he managed to be so positive all the time. He told me that he had learned to ignore blackjack and focus on his love life.

"What do you mean?" I asked him.

"Well," Alex said, "Blackjack is a game that's designed to make you lose money. But if you focus on your love life, you'll be much happier in the long run."

I thought about what he said for a while and eventually decided to try it out for myself. And you know what? He was right! Focusing on my love life made me a lot happier than spending all my time worrying about blackjack.

If you're looking for a way to ignore blackjack and focus on your love life, here are a few tips that can help:

1. Make time for yourself: One of the best ways to focus on your love life is to make time for yourself. This means taking some time each day to relax and enjoy your own company. Whether you want to read a book, take a walk or just sit back and relax, taking some time for yourself is a great way to de-stress and recharge your batteries.

2. Spend time with loved ones: Another great way to focus on your love life is to spend time with loved ones. Whether you go out for dinner, watch a movie or just hang out at home, spending quality time with loved ones is a great way to connect with them and strengthen your relationships.

3. Talk about your goals: Finally, another great way to focus on your love life is to talk about your goals with others. This means sharing your dreams and aspirations with friends and family members, and asking them for their support in achieving them. Talking about your goals helps keep them front and center in your mind, making it easier to stay focused on achieving them.

#  How to Ignore Blackjack and Live a Happy Life

Casinos can be fun places to visit, but they’re not always the best places to gamble. For one, the odds are usually stacked against you. For another, casino games can be addictive and potentially ruin your life.

Blackjack is a particularly risky game to play. Not only is the house edge relatively high, but blackjack also has a habit of tempting players into making bad decisions. If you want to avoid the dangers of blackjack and live a happy life, here are a few tips to follow:

1. Avoid casinos altogether

If you don’t live near a casino, there’s no need to worry about temptation. Simply stay away from casinos and you won’t be tempted to gamble.

2. Set limits for yourself

When you do visit a casino, set limits for yourself and stick to them. Decide how much money you’re willing to lose and how long you’re going to stay in the casino. Once you reach your limit, leave immediately.

3. Only gamble with money you can afford to lose

Gambling with money you can’t afford to lose is a surefire way to go broke quickly. Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose without it affecting your day-to-day life.

4. Don’t drink or use drugs while gambling

Drinking or using drugs while gambling can cloud your judgement and lead to bad decisions. Keep yourself sober and clearheaded while gambling so that you can make sensible choices.

5. Quit while you’re ahead

If you’re winning, quit while you’re ahead! There’s no point in risking your hard-earned money on a game that’s likely to end in defeat. Walk away with your profits still in hand – it’s better than losing everything!

#  How to Ignore Blackjack and Still Get Ahead

In any casino, the house edge is always there, lurking in the wings like a vulture, ready to snatch your hard-earned money away. But, what if there were a game that had a house edge of zero? You’d be crazy not to play it!

Well, as it turns out, there is such a game – and it’s called blackjack. In fact, if you know how to play blackjack properly, you can actually come out ahead of the casino!

But before we get into the nitty-gritty of blackjack strategy, let’s first take a look at the basics of the game. Blackjack is a card game that is played between a player and a dealer. The aim of the game is to collect cards with point values totaling 21 or less, without going over. The player wins if their hand is higher than the dealer’s hand, without going bust.

If you want to learn more about blackjack strategy and how to increase your chances of winning, keep reading!

The most important thing to remember when playing blackjack is that you should never go over 21. If your hand exceeds 21 points, you automatically lose – no matter what the dealer’s hand is like. So, always aim to hit until you have a total of 21 or less.

Another thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack is that the Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what number will help you win the hand. For example, if you are dealt an Ace and a King (total = 13), you should ‘hit’ again – because 13 is lower than 21. However, if you are dealt an Ace and a 2 (total = 3), you should stand (because 3 is lower than 21).

If you want to take some risks and try and double your bet, you can do so by hitting ‘double down’ when it’s available. This allows you to double your bet after seeing your first two cards – but be warned, if things don’t go your way then you will lose both your original bet and the doubled amount!

Now that we know some basic blackjack strategy, let’s take a look at how we can improve our chances of winning even further!

One way of improving your odds at blackjack is by using basic counting methods. By keeping track of which cards have been played so far (and therefore which ones are still left in the deck), you can make informed decisions about when to hit and when to stand. This takes some practice but can be well worth it in the long run.

Another way of increasing your chances of winning at blackjack is by using advanced strategy charts. These charts tell you exactly what move to make in any given situation – depending on what cards are showing on the table. While they may seem daunting at first glance, they are actually very easy to use with a bit of practice.


So next time you head off to the casino armed with just this article – give blackjack a try! With a bit of luck and some sound strategy under your belt, who knows – maybe YOU could be coming out ahead instead of the casino!

#  How to Ignore Blackjack: Tips from the Master

In any casino game, your goal is to beat the house. This is not easy, but it is possible with smart play. In blackjack, there are a few basic rules you can follow to minimize the casino’s edge and give yourself the best chance to win.

The first thing to remember is never to take insurance. The house has an advantage of around 2.5% when you take insurance, so it’s always better to pass on this option.

Another important rule is to never split 10s. This gives the house an edge of around 4%. When you have two 10s, you’re better off standing pat.

You should also only double down on hands that offer a good chance of winning. For instance, don’t double down on 9s or 8s – the house has an advantage of around 11% in these cases. Instead, double down when you have pairs like Aces or Kings. This will give you a better chance of winning and minimize the house edge.

By following these simple tips, you can reduce the casino’s edge and increase your chances of winning at blackjack.
