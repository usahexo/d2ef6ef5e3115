#  Delaware and Nevada Officially Launch State-Sponsored Online Gambling

Delaware and Nevada have become the first US states to offer legal, state-sponsored online gambling. This past week, both states confirmed the launch of their new online gambling platforms, which will allow residents to gamble on casino games, poker, and other gambling activities from the comfort of their homes.

While only Delaware and Nevada have launched online gambling platforms thus far, it is expected that more states will follow suit in the coming months. In particular, New Jersey is expected to launch its own online gambling platform in the coming weeks.

Nevada has been offering legal online poker since 2013, but this is the first time that residents will be able to gamble on casino games and other activities online. Delaware's online gambling platform went live on October 31st and includes slots, table games, and poker.

The new platforms are being offered in partnership with Atlantic City casinos such as Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Tropicana Entertainment, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, and Resorts Casino Hotel. Residents of both states must be physically located within state borders in order to access the platforms.

The move towards state-sponsored online gambling comes as no surprise, as research has shown that there is a growing demand for such services. A study by Global Market Advisors found that nearly 60% of Americans would participate in legal online gambling if it was available in their state.

With more states expected to follow suit in the coming months, it looks like online gambling is here to stay. So if you're interested in trying your luck at some casino games or poker, be sure to check out your state's online gambling platform soon!

#  New Jersey Will Follow Suit, Launch State-Sponsored Online Gambling in Late 2017

New Jersey is following in the footsteps of Nevada, as the state prepares to launch its own state-sponsored online gambling platform in late 2017. This move comes as a response to the increasing popularity of online gambling, as well as the success of Nevada’s program.

Details about the New Jersey program are still being finalized, but it is expected that the platform will include a range of games, including poker, slots, and blackjack. Players will be able to access the platform from their computers or mobile devices, and can place bets against other players or against the house.

The New Jersey Gaming Enforcement Division is currently working with several gaming operators to develop the platform. Once it is up and running, players will be able to sign up for an account and start playing right away. The Division is also looking into expanding the program to include online sports betting in the future.

The launch of New Jersey’s online gambling platform is sure to be a major boon for the state’s gaming industry. It is estimated that the program could generate over $180 million in revenue annually, not to mention create hundreds of jobs. This stands in sharp contrast to Nevada’s online gambling program, which has generated just $26 million in revenue since it launched in 2013.

It remains to be seen how successful New Jersey’s program will be, but there is no doubt that it represents a major step forward for legalized online gambling in the United States.

#  Pennsylvania Looks to Join Other States in Offering Legal Online Gambling

Pennsylvania may be the next state to offer legal, regulated online gambling.

Senate Bill 707 was introduced in February of 2019 and would legalize online gambling within the state.

The bill allows for a number of different types of gambling including poker, casino games, and sports betting. It would also allow for online lottery sales.

Pennsylvania is one of only a few states that does not offer any form of legal online gambling. If SB707 passes, the state would join a growing list of states that have legalized some form of internet gambling.

In 2017, New Jersey became the first state to offer legal online gambling. Since then, several other states have followed suit including Delaware, Nevada, and Pennsylvania.

Supporters of SB707 say that it will provide much-needed revenue for the state. They argue that legalizing online gambling will help to offset some of the decline in revenue from traditional forms of gambling such as casinos and lotteries.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction problems and other negative consequences. They also say that it could hurt brick-and-mortar casinos in the state.

#  California Could Introduce Legislation to Legalize Online Gambling This Year

California is looking to legalize online gambling this year, according to a statement from Assemblyman Adam Gray (D-Merced) on January 10.

If the proposed bill is passed, it will allow Californians to bet on horse races, fantasy sports, and casino games online.

Gray believes that the legislation could generate up to $1 billion in tax revenue for the state.

“This is an issue that has long needed attention,” said Gray in his statement. “It is an issue of equity and fairness. California’s gaming landscape is out of date with the rest of the world. Technology has changed, but our laws have not.”

Gray introduced a similar bill last year but it did not make it out of committee. However, he believes that there is more political support for the legislation this year and that it has a better chance of passing.

The move to legalize online gambling in California comes as other states are also considering similar measures. In December, New Jersey became the first state to legalize sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice. Delaware and West Virginia have also legalized sports betting, and Pennsylvania is expected to do so soon.

If California were to legalize online gambling, it would join Nevada and New Jersey as states where both online poker and casino games are legal.

#  Massachusetts Considers Joining the Ranks of States with Legalized Online Gambling

In a move that could bolster the state's coffers, Massachusetts lawmakers are considering legalizing online gambling.

Online gambling is currently legal in a handful of states, including New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada. The industry is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, and interest in it has been growing in recent years.

Proponents of online gambling argue that it would be a boon to the state economy, generating much-needed revenue for the government. They also say that it would create jobs and stimulate tourism.

Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and could lead to gambling addiction problems. They also say that it could be used by criminals to launder money.

The fate of online gambling in Massachusetts remains to be seen. But with other states moving forward with legalization, it is likely only a matter of time before Massachusetts joins them.
