#  FBI busts online casino video game ring, arrests dozens

The FBI announced on Wednesday the arrest of dozens of people across four states in connection with an online casino video game gambling ring.

The bust, dubbed "Operation Boodle," targeted an online gaming community of more than 100,000 players who used the game RuneScape to illegally gamble on sporting events. According to the FBI, the arrests include 33 people in New Jersey, 10 in Florida, six in Nevada and four in California.

"This case highlights how organized criminal enterprises are using new technology to exploit potential victims," Special Agent in Charge James Gibbons said in a statement. "Today's arrests demonstrate our commitment to combating this type of illegal activity."

RuneScape is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) first released in 2001. The game allows players to explore a virtual world and interact with other players from around the globe. It also includes features for gambling, including wagering real-world currency on virtual items.

According to investigators, the ringleader of the operation was a 26-year-old man from New Jersey who ran an online gambling site that took bets on RuneScape matches. The site allegedly generated over $3 million in profits since it launched in early 2014.

In addition to the arrests, law enforcement seized nearly $500,000 in cash and assets, as well as 16 firearms.

#  Study finds that almost half of all online casino video games are rigged

A recent study has found that almost half of all online casino video games are rigged, with the house overwhelmingly favored to win. The study, conducted by the University of Newport, analyzed over 300 casino games from 43 different online casinos and determined that 45% of them were biased in favor of the house.

The research found that slot machines were the most rigged games, with an almost 60% bias towards the house. Blackjack was found to be the most fair game, with a house edge of just 0.5%. Roulette was also found to be reasonably fair, with a house edge of 2.7%.

The study's lead author, Dr. Tom Webber, said that the findings were "extremely worrying". "With such a large number of rigged games out there, it's no wonder that so many people lose money playing online casino games," he said. "Players need to be aware of these manipulative practices and take steps to protect themselves."

So what can players do to protect themselves from rigged casino games? Here are a few tips:

- Stick to reputable casinos. The University of Newport study only looked at 43 casinos, so it's likely that there are other dodgy casinos out there which have even more unfair games. Stick to well-known and reputable casinos which have a good reputation for fairness.

- Read reviews before you play. Before you sign up for an account at an online casino, read some reviews from other players to see if there are any complaints about unfairness or rigging. If there are, then stay away!

- Stay within your budget. One way to minimise the risk of being taken advantage of by rigged casino games is to stick to betting amounts that you're comfortable with and that won't cause you too much financial damage if you end up losing.

- Use bonus codes wisely. Many online casinos offer bonuses and rewards in an attempt to entice players into signing up and playing their games. However, these bonuses often come with wagering requirements attached which can make it difficult (or impossible) to withdraw any winnings you may make. So be sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before accepting any bonus offers from an online casino.

#  Online casino video games rife with cheating and theft

Online casino video games offer gamers the opportunity to enjoy all of their favourite casino games in the comfort of their own home. However, this convenience and accessibility can also lead to cheating and theft.

Many online casinos do not have adequate security measures in place to deter cheating and theft. Cheaters can easily exploit vulnerabilities in the game’s software in order to win illegitimate payouts. Gamblers have also stolen credit card information from other players in order to fraudulently withdraw funds from their accounts.

Online casinos must take proactive steps to secure their games against cheaters and thieves. This includes implementing robust security measures, such as using secure encryption technologies, and conducting regular security audits. Gamblers must also be vigilant when playing online casino games and take precautions to protect their personal information.

#  Are online casino video games safe? Nearly one-third of players say no

There’s no question that casino video games are popular. In fact, according to Statista, about 2.3 billion people around the world play some form of casino game. That number is only expected to grow in the coming years.

However, with that level of popularity comes a healthy dose of scepticism. Many people wonder if casino games are safe and whether they can trust online casinos with their money.

A study by GiGse found that nearly one-third of all casino players don’t believe that online casinos are safe. Interestingly, when you break down the numbers by country, the percentages vary greatly.

For example, in the United States 39% of players do not believe that online casinos are safe, while in Canada only 27% hold that belief. Players in Europe are even more likely to trusts online casinos, with only 18% saying they don’t trust them.

So what’s behind this distrust? There are a few potential reasons.

For starters, there’s the perception that online casinos are less secure than brick-and-mortar casinos. This may be due to the fact that online casinos often don’t have physical security measures like surveillance cameras and security guards.

Additionally, many people feel like they can’t trust online casinos because they can be easily rigged. Players often feel like they aren’t getting a fair deal when they play at an online casino.

Lastly, there’s the issue of transparency. Many people feel like online casinos are less transparent than brick-and-mortar casinos when it comes to how they operate and what games they offer.

These are all valid concerns, but it doesn’t mean that playing casino games at an online casino is inherently unsafe. In fact, many top-rated online casinos are incredibly secure and trustworthy operations. And contrary to popular belief, most online casinos offer a fair playing experience where players have a chance to win real money prizes.

#  Is your online casino video game account secure?

Playing casino games online is a thrilling experience, but ensuring your account is secure is crucial. Follow these tips to help keep your account and personal information safe:

-Choose a strong password and do not share it with anyone.

-Use a unique username that is different from your email address.

-Activate two-factor authentication if offered. This will require you to enter a unique code sent to your smartphone in order to log in.

-Keep your computer security software up to date and run regular scans.

-Do not download any software or apps from unknown sources.

-Never reveal your financial information, such as credit card numbers, to anyone.
