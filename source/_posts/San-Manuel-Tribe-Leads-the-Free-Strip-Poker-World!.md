#  San Manuel Tribe Leads the Free Strip Poker World!

The San Manuel Tribe of Southern California has announced that it will be the first tribe in the world to offer free strip poker to its members.

The tribe's chairman, Lynn Valbuena, says that the decision was made in order to "enhance the social and recreational experiences of our members."

Valbuena went on to say that the new game would be a great way for families and friends to bond and have fun together.

"We are really excited about this new offering," said Valbuena. "It is sure to be a lot of fun for everyone who participates."

In addition to being free to play, strip poker will also be available around the clock, 24/7. This means that players can enjoy a game any time they feel like it.

While some may see the new game as simply a way to get naked, others see it as an opportunity for personal growth.
