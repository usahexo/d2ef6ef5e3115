#  RB Leipzig become Bundesliga Champions after doubling up on their opponents!

RB Leipzig become Bundesliga champions after doubling up on their opponents. Winning 2-0 against an out of sorts Eintracht Frankfurt side, Ralph Hasenh√ºttl‚Äôs team clinch their first ever Bundesliga title and write themselves into the history books.

Goals from strikers Timo Werner and Yussuf Poulsen were enough to seal the victory, with Leipzig keeping a clean sheet in the process. It was a deserved win for the team who have been the most consistent performers in Germany this season.

After a shaky start to life in the top division, RB Leipzig have come good when it mattered most and are now worthy champions. With the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbapp√© and Edinson Cavani dominating headlines in Ligue 1, few people will have heard of Timo Werner or Yussuf Poulsen. That may change soon however, as both strikers have shown they are able to cut it at the very highest level.

For Werner it is his second successive championship triumph, having helped RB Salzburg win the Austrian Bundesliga last season. The 20-year-old has been one of Europe‚Äôs most lethal marksmen this season, scoring 24 goals in all competitions. His strike partner Poulsen is also no slouch, having netted 14 times this term.

Leipzig‚Äôs success has not been without its controversy though. There have been accusations of financial doping and breaching financial fair play rules, but these have failed to take away from what has been an impressive league campaign.

The players themselves seem unaffected by all the off-field drama and are just enjoying their football. Captain Willi Orban spoke after the game about how proud he was of his teammates: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going crazy! We‚Äôre all delighted that we‚Äôve won the title together as a team ‚Äì it‚Äôs unbelievable! I don‚Äôt think anyone expected us to do this at the start of the season‚Ä¶ I hope we can celebrate properly now! This club is incredibly special to me ‚Äì it means everything to me! To be part of this history is amazing!‚Äù

He is not alone in feeling that way about RB Leipzig and there will be plenty of fans celebrating long into the night now that their club are Bundesliga champions.

#  RB Leipzig become the third team in Bundesliga history to double their opponent's score!

On Saturday, RB Leipzig pulled off an impressive victory against Bayer Leverkusen, beating them 4-2. The match was Claudiu Ke»ôer√º's debut for the club, and he made it a memorable one by scoring two goals.

This was Leipzig's third consecutive victory in the Bundesliga and their biggest win of the season so far. They are now up to fifth place in the table, just two points behind fourth-place Hoffenheim.

Bayer Leverkusen started the game strongly, creating some good chances early on. However, it was RB Leipzig who took the lead in the 18th minute when Yussuf Poulsen scored from close range.

The home side continued to dominate after taking the lead and they doubled their advantage in the 36th minute when Ke»ôer√º scored his first goal for the club.

Leipzig continued to control the game in the second half and they made it 3-0 in the 54th minute when Jean-Kevin Augustin scored with a header.

#  RB Leipzig triumph 6-0 against FC Schalke 04 with a doubled up offence!

A rampant RB Leipzig side thrashed FC Schalke 04 6-0 on Saturday, inflicting the heaviest home Bundesliga defeat on the Royal Blues in their history.

Powered by their vociferous support, Ralph Hasenh√ºttl's team ran riot at the Veltins Arena. Emil Forsberg and Marcel Sabitzer got two apiece, with Timo Werner and Yussuf Poulsen also scoring.

It was a superb performance from Leipzig, who showed no mercy against their rivals in front of a capacity crowd of 61,581. The result moves them up to second in the table, five points behind leaders Bayern Munich.

Schalke have now lost four successive home league games for the first time in their history.

#  RB Leipzig earn an impressive 2-0 victory against Hamburger SV via a doubled up defence!

The Bundesliga game between RB Leipzig and Hamburger SV saw pretty much all the goals come in the first half. RB Leipzig earned a clean 2-0 victory, with both goals being conceded by the away side.

Leipzig started off the brighter of the two sides, with Timo Werner testing Christian Mathenia in the Hamburg goal inside 5 minutes. However, it was the visitors who took the lead in controversial circumstances on 17 minutes. Bobby Wood looked to have been fouled by Willi Orban inside the area, but referee Felix Zwayer allowed play to continue and Nicolai Muller converted from the rebound after Peter Gulacsi had saved his initial effort.

RB Leipzig were not behind for long, though, as they equalised just 2 minutes later. Marcel Sabitzer‚Äôs corner was flicked on at the near post by Dayot Upamecano, and Emil Forsberg was on hand to head into an empty net. The home side then went ahead midway through the first half, with Jean-Kevin Augustin scoring his first goal for RB Leipzig. A quick counterattack involving Forsberg and Werner saw the ball played across to Augustin who finished clinically past Mathenia.

The second half was a much more subdued affair, as neither side created many clear-cut chances. Hamburg did have one good opportunity to get back into the game when Luca Waldschmidt‚Äôs header was saved well by Gulacsi, but ultimately they were unable to find a way past a resolute RB Leipzig defence.
